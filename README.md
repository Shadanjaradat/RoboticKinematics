# RoboticKinematics
This is an experimental project on the Lynxmotion Robot arm on MATLAB.


Task 1 :

Derive the inverse kinematics for the Lynxmotion arm using the Robotic Toolbox in MATLAB. Test your IK model in 3 different Cartesian positions and demonstrate the accuracy of your model.


Task 2 : 

Plan a task* in MATLAB with at least 5 positions, plot the robot and show your investigation. This process should give you 5 sets of Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) and angles yaw, pitch, roll specifying the end-effector position and orientation in 3D space.


Task 3 : 

Solve the Inverse Kinematics for these positions in 3D space and obtain sets of Joint Parameters. Create an appropriate plot/animation in MATLAB (use Robotic Toolbox) for the motion of the robot. MOVE THE ROBOT between the points (film the motion of the robot and provide the video).
